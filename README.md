## Student Grade Tracker

### Overview

The Student Grade Tracker is a Java application designed to help users manage and track student grades for various subjects or assignments. This program allows users to input grades, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade along with additional information such as the letter grade.

### Features

- **Add Grades**: Input grades for different subjects or assignments.
- **Calculate Average**: Compute the average of all entered grades.
- **Display Grades**: Show all entered grades, the calculated average, and the corresponding letter grade.
- **Letter Grade Calculation**: Convert numeric averages to letter grades (A, B, C, D, F).

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple and effective way to manage and track student grades. It demonstrates essential Java programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, user input handling, data storage using collections, arithmetic operations, control flow, and method usage. This project serves as a practical exercise for those learning Java and can be extended with additional features as needed.

### Usage

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. **Navigate to the project directory**.
3. **Compile the program** using a Java compiler:
    ```bash
    javac StudentGradeTracker.java
    ```
4. **Run the program** using the Java interpreter:
    ```bash
    java StudentGradeTracker
    ```
5. **Follow the on-screen instructions** to:
    - Add grades for various subjects or assignments.
    - Calculate and display the average grade.
    - View all entered grades along with the overall average and letter grade.

### Future Improvements

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Implement a GUI for better user interaction.
- **Additional Metrics**: Include more metrics such as GPA calculation.
- **Export/Import Functionality**: Allow users to export grades to a file or import grades from a file.
- **Grade Categories**: Support different categories of grades (e.g., homework, exams) with weighted averages.
